| pages      | This directory is responsible for containing all the different page / screen components of the application. In this application, each screen represents a different tab. The screen will contain as much business logic as possible such that all children components are concerned solely with presentation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| components | This directory is responsible for containing all components to be displayed within the various different screens. This directory is broken up into subdirectories based on the respective screens that the components relate to. Components in this directory should contain as little business logic as possible and instead be used for presentation.<br><br>It is worth noting that the presentation layer may perform callbacks to the business or data layer in order to invoke changes upstream. However, ideally the components should contain as little state as possible. This logic should be handled upstream within the respective screens. |
| services   | This directory is responsible for containing all managers within the application. In this application, managers handle a particular stream of information, and can sometimes contain their own ObserverSubject. This is a generic class designed to handle callback subscriptions. This particular aspect bridges between the data and business layer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| monitors   | This directory is responsible for containing all the monitors of the application. In this application, monitors are used to subscribe to different subjects and will perform an action under given circumstance. An example of this would be a battery monitor that subscribes the event feed and will trigger on a low battery reading.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| external   | This directory is responsible for containing all files that perform actions external to the application as a package. Examples of this would be push notifications that interact with the OS to send an external notification. Another example would be the storage interface that can interact with information stored locally on the device.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| lib        | This directory contains various different utility-like classes that do not contain any business logic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| index.tsx | This file acts as the main index file that is initially loaded by the browser within this directory. This file will inject the React components into `public/index.html` to render the dynamic web pages. |
| App.tsx   | This component is the highest level component within the React hierarchy. This component both handles all routing of the application.                                                                     |
